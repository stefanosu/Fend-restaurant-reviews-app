In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this and most people have it already installed on their computer.

In terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, run the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000
